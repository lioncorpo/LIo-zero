## Requirements

zmq4 is just a wrapper for the ZeroMQ library. It doesn't include the
library itself. So you need to have ZeroMQ installed, including its
development files. On Linux and Darwin you can check this with (`$` is
the command prompt):

```
$ pkg-config --modversion libzmq
4.3.1
```

The Go compiler must be able to compile C code. You can check this
with:
```
$ go env CGO_ENABLED
1
```

You can't do cross-compilation. That would disable C.

## Install

go get github.com/pebbe/zmq4
